In array and object we shouldnot define data type to create variable like (int a = 1;) in Java but in js we can direct use var a = 1;

object => Object is enclosed inside curly braces {}. In object we should not define data type.
There are various ways to access object. object contains both name and value.

array => array is also object but it contains only value. It is closed inside big bracket.



function => function is a set of statement that performs a task for calculate a value
It is executed when it is invoked or called.
